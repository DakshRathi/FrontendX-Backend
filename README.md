This repository contains the backend service for the **Performance Benchmarking Tool**, a submission for the FrontendX hackathon. The service analyzes any given website's frontend performance using the Google PageSpeed Insights API and provides AI-driven optimization tips through an interactive chat interface powered by the Groq LLM API.

## ✨ Features

-   **🚀 Performance Analysis**: Get key frontend performance metrics for any website (mobile or desktop).
-   **📊 Key Metrics**: Displays core web vitals like LCP, TBT, CLS, and the overall performance score.
-   **🤖 AI-Powered Suggestions**: Provides an initial, high-level performance summary generated by an LLM upon analysis.
-   **💬 Interactive Chat**: Engage in a continuous chat with an AI expert ("Pulse") to get detailed, context-aware optimization advice.
-   **📄 Full Report Download**: An endpoint to download the complete raw JSON report from the Google PageSpeed Insights API.
-   **🐳 Dockerized**: Fully containerized with Docker for easy setup and consistent deployment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
-   **AI/LLM**: Groq (using LLaMA 3), LangChain
-   **Performance Analysis**: Google PageSpeed Insights API
-   **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
-   **Data Validation**: Pydantic
-   **Asynchronous HTTP Client**: HTTPX

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Git
-   Python 3.11+
-   Docker

### Local Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/DakshRathi/FrontendX-Backend.git
    cd FrontendX-Backend
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Create the environment file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the project root and add your API keys.

    ```
    # .env

    # Get your API key from Google Cloud Console
    # https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/get-started
    PAGESPEED_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_PAGESPEED_API_KEY"

    # Get your API key from GroqCloud
    # https://console.groq.com/keys
    GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
    ```

## 🚀 Running the Application

You can run the application directly with Uvicorn or with Docker.

### Method 1: Locally with Uvicorn

This is useful for simple, direct testing.
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Method 2: Using Docker (Recommended)

This is the standard way to run the application, as it replicates a production-like environment.
```bash
docker build -t <username>/frontendx .
docker run -p 8000:8000 <username>/frontendx
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. You can view the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## 📖 API Endpoints

### 1. Analyze Website

Triggers a new performance analysis, gets an initial AI suggestion, and returns key metrics.

-   **Endpoint**: `POST /api/analyze`
-   **Request Body**:
    ```
    {
      "url": "https://www.google.com",
      "strategy": "desktop"
    }
    ```
-   **Success Response (200 OK)**:
    ```
    {
      "performance_score": 95,
      "metrics": [
        { "title": "First Contentful Paint", "value": "0.8 s" },
        { "title": "Largest Contentful Paint", "value": "1.2 s" }
      ],
      "initial_suggestion": "Hello! Your site shows excellent performance with a score of 95. To get even faster, you could look into optimizing the delivery of your JavaScript files. What would you like to explore first?"
    }
    ```

### 2. Chat with AI

Sends the chat history and the user's new query to the LLM for a streamed response.

-   **Endpoint**: `POST /api/chat`
-   **Request Body**:
    ```
    {
      "history": [
        { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! How can I help you optimize your site today?" },
        { "role": "user", "content": "Tell me more about the JavaScript execution time." }
      ]
    }
    ```
-   **Success Response (200 OK)**: A streaming response (`text/event-stream`) with chunks of the AI's answer.

### 3. Download Full Report

Allows the user to download the complete raw JSON data from the PageSpeed Insights API.

-   **Endpoint**: `GET /api/download-report`
-   **Response**: A JSON file download named `lighthouse_report.json`.

## 🏆 Hackathon Submission Criteria

This backend was designed to help meet the following hackathon judging criteria:

-   **Code Quality and Modularity**: The code is structured into services, models, and a core configuration module, promoting separation of concerns.
-   **Creativity and Technical Challenge**: Integrates a powerful LLM (Groq) with a standard performance tool (Pagespeed) to create an innovative, interactive user experience.
-   **Documentation and Demo Readiness**: This README and the auto-generated FastAPI docs make the API easy to understand and use. The Dockerized setup ensures the demo is ready to run anywhere.
